From the Tupi people of Amazonia to the Algonquian of the Chesapeake region, indigenous peoples harvested passionflowers as medicinal and culinary plants long before the arrival of Europeans to the Americas. Archaeological research suggests evidence of human consumption of Passiflora incarnata as early as the Late Archaic period (c. 1000 BCE) in the region that now constitutes the Southeastern United States. Early colonial accounts of the Americas offer the first European descriptions of this unfamiliar genus of plants. The Spanish conquistador, Pedro Cieza de Leon, wrote of delicious granadillas or “little pomegranates” growing near Cali — contemporary Colombia— in the sixteenth century. At the early Jamestown settlement in the British Virginia Colony, Captain John Smith’s 1607-9 diary described the use of Passiflora incarnata in indigenous horticulture. The Powhatan people, he wrote, plant “Maracocks a wild fruit like a lemmon, which also increase infinitely: they begin to ripe in September and continue till the end of October.”

While many plants in the Passiflora genus offer edible fruits, it was their flower which enchanted Europeans across their global empires in the seventeenth century and gave rise to the plants’ modern name. In 1590, a Spanish Jesuit missionary, José de Acosta, wrote that the granadilla flower is locally “esteemed” for having the “emblems of the Passion”; “the nails, the pillar, the lashes, the Crown of Thorns, and the wounds” are found in it. Acosta’s comparison referred to the “Arma Christi” or “Instruments of the Passion”: the objects involved in Jesus’ final suffering, crucifixion, and death preceding his resurrection in the Christian Gospels. These objects — such as the column of Jesus’ flagellation or the nails of the crucifixion — were metonyms of Jesus in late medieval and Early Modern art and material culture. The botanist, Nicolás Monardes, corroborated Acosta’s account of the plant’s Christian symbolism in 1574, and in 1608, a group of either Jesuits or Augustinians presented Pope Paul V with a dried specimen of the flower which held the instruments of the passion. By the early seventeenth century pamphlets across the Spanish Empire wrote of the “Flower of the Passion.”

Early seventeenth-century religious works elucidated the symbolism contained within the flower’s morphology. In 1609 in Bologna, Simone Parlasca published, The Flower of the Granadiglia, or of The Passion of Our Lord Jesus Christ, which compiled prose, poetry, and woodcut and copper engravings depicting the plant. These exaggerated illustrations did as much to popularize the plant’s Christian symbolism as did written descriptions. Giovanni Rossi’s accompanying illustrations depict an exaggerated passionflower plant whose coronal filaments form Jesus’ Crown of Thorns and whose stylized stigmas resemble the three nails which pinned him to the cross. Though the most common passionflower species have trifoliate leaves, the Bolognese illustrations picture oval leaves, which subsequent illustrations often emulated. One Jesuit polemicist assessed in 1610 that the plant’s leaves are shaped like the “point of the lance that pierced through the side of Christ our Lord.” Other seventeenth century contemporaries identified the flower’s five stamens with the wounds Jesus suffered on the cross, inspiring another early name for the flower: la Flor de las cinco llagas, or “Flower of the Five Wounds.”

Catholics within Europe and across growing European empires conceived of the passionflower both as a natural wonder and a mystery of the faith, which inspired piety and licensed the Church’s global conquest. In a 1609 letter written during Spain’s attempted invasion and Christianization of Cambodia, the anonymous author included a woodcut of the flower, describing them as “flowers of the ineffable mystery,” and natural “wonders” which demonstrated God’s love to the sinner. The author assessed that “such beautiful flowers Christ wanted to give us, that in paradise he does not give better ones, because he treats the sinner with love.” He concluded “see if it will be a pledge of love with reason, because God entrusts his passion in it so that his sacred renown might be grasped….God is a gardener of the sacred flowers which no human cultivates. So come, Christians, for it is not righteous to conceal such a wonder, but rather it is seen that God wants the soil to become Heaven.” With these words, he expressed a reverence rooted in the natural world which lent credence to Spain’s violent crusade to spread Catholicism in Southeast Asia. By enthralling the “popular curiosity” with the passionflower, these religious pamphlets were an “effective instrument for the diffusion of the evangelical message of the Jesuits.”
